PEOPLES REVIEW:
'Placements of NITK are the BEST. Mostly every student will get placed and most of them will get high packages. Many companies will visit the NITK, companies such as Amazon, Google, Flipkart, etc big companies will visit NITK.'


'The Placement Policy at NITK is Excellent. You get internships and Pre-placement offers at end of the third-year summer and final placements in your final year summer. CS/IT students get internships from the second year itself if they participated in their campus engagement activities. The competition will give you intern and the internship give you placement! but only a few people get it! Usually, all the students get placement by end of graduation. There are around 436 Companies Visited and more than 1100 offers made with the highest package at 52 LPA from D E Shaw followed by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Adobe, etc. When it comes to core Companies we have BPCL with 22.86 LPA followed by MRPL, Bajaj, Hyundai, Caterpillar, Dr. Reddy's Lab, Adani Enterprises, Reliance Industries, etc. Placements are good on Campus. if you are from the coding sector then the average package would be 16 LPA. If you are from the core sector then your average package would be 9 LPA. I plan to get some work and go for higher studies.'

'The placement stats are really good even in comparison to other nits, it goes around 95 per cent. Almost all big companies come. People start their preparation for college placement around the 3rd year. The internship also happens around that time only.'

'Placement at NIT Karnataka is very good. Students become eligible for placement after 6th semester. This year (2022), placement rate for BTech student was approx 97%. About 450 companies visited the NITK. 214 student got the Pre placement offer from 57 companies. The highest Package this year was 45 LPA. My plan before getting the degree is to place in a very good company.'
