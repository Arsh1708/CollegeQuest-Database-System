PEOPLES REVIEW:

'college is huge so you will have all the facilities and the architecture is beautiful especially the b.arch building , classrooms are non ac with projectors {some are ac rooms} decent size to seat 60-70 students, coming to hostels, again given the amount of students it's difficult job to maintain it, apart from 10 floor blocks rest all are very clean, due to the huge amount of students in the 10 floor blocks they aren't that much clean and maintained'



quality of teaching depends teacher to teacher, just like in every institute, lucklily i've come across some really great faculties in VIT during my last three sems, to be honest some subjects are not required to be taught to a CSE student and won't help you in general unless you're aiming for that field'



'CSE placements have been good, 7,000+ offers and highest placement was 75LPA this year with around 81 students getting an offer of 25LPA or more with 8.19L being the average salary offered, top companies were microsof, deshaw, amazon, paypal'



'it's fine, there are restrictions and the in-time is early but college does host activities like we have 

monday music time to time sometimes there are dance performance in the common ground, vellore is a nice small place and you'll find almost everything here with some major brands showrooms nearby'
