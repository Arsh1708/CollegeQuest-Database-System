PEOPLES REVIEW:
” World class campus, top class institute. I have studied here. And i really miss this place. This campus offers faar better facilities than many well known corporations. Students from all over India study here. Many amenities like sports club, gym, swimming pool etc are free to access for students. Area of campus is huge. A well established hospital with ambulance is inside the campus. A shopping center, food corner, bank, post office all are available within the campus.”

“One of the best Engineering Institute in India. It also provides programmes in various domains such as MBA, M.Tech, MCA and recently they have started M.A curriculum to diversify their individuality. Teachers here are more experienced and dedicated. If you ever get a chance to get into this primier institute do not miss the chance."
