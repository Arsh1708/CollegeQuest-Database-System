PEOPLES REVIEW: 

 

‘I always had the will to join this college because of the environment, like, it's at a remote area and I found most of my seniors joining here. I had heard from my seniors that the teaching is also too good here. That's the reason I opted this college.’ 

 

‘I choose cs because it has good scope and college is near by so I choosed it , basically I had lack of knowledge about engineering and CET entrance process and also without proper guidance i applied for this college for government seat if I choose good college I could get it ,it's okay I will work hard for my future and I joined this college on 5-06-2017' 

 

‘I wish it were more filled with students and good food corners since it's lacking in that area but other than that Thier more of encouraging in all fest's, sports and games. Not just that workshop, talk from other famous people, local festivals etc’
