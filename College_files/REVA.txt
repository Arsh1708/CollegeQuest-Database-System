PEOPLES REVIEW:

'Infrastructure of the campus is very beautiful. Reva University is full of greenery. There are a number of facilities like foodcourt, library, playground, gym, bank, auditorium etc. The quality of mess food and canteen food is really good too. There is a hospital in college in case of medical emergencies.'

'The infrastructure of our college is very good and unique. Students will like the ground and our block. Wi-Fi is not good in our college, and classrooms are average. Library is very good for students.'
